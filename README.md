You should be able to pull this repo right into your Sublime Text 2/Packages/User directory.

That directory is usually located at /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User, but if you're using a newer version of OSX or are on a PC/Linux, you can use navigate to File -> Preferences -> Browse Packages... to get to the directory quickly.
